    <h1>Portfolio: Judah Wyman </h1> <!--Not true info but hopefully will be in a couple of years-->
    <p>I am Judah Wyman, a professional audio engineer based out of Baton Rouge,
      but travels around the country often. I have worked with many well-known
      artists and have done work for a multitude of different projects of various
      scales and budgets. I have also worked with many different companies across
      the country and many teams. My work ranges from hip-hop and rap to electronic
      and orchestral. I am here to help you get the perfect soundscape you are
      looking for in your current project.
